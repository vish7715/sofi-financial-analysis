# SOFi Technologies – Financial Performance & Tech-First Strategy Analysis

## 📌 Business Use Case
SOFi Technologies, a US based financial technology company that provides digital-only platform for all financial needs including banking, lending, investing/crypto integrating all in one digital app. SOFi started as a student loan re-financing company in 2011 then grew into a digital financial services platform and went public in January 2021. Since then , it lists its financial statements to public via US Securities and Exchange Commission.


SOFi operates mainly as three segments - Lending Segment (student , personal & housing loans),Financial Services (checking/savings account,investing/crypto) and Technology Platform(technology infrastructure as Technisys and payments infrastructure via Galileo). 

For this project, public data available on SEC EDGAR website as 10-K/10Q statements via SEC APIs is used to analyse SOFi performance over past 5 years from 2020-2024 and its strategy analysis for tech-first platform.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
The analysis focuses on the following key financial metrics:

- **Revenue Analysis**  
10K consolidated income statements data is extracted and used to calculate metrics as to how much revenue is generated per business segment across all 3 segments over a time frame of 5 years that helped in understanding the most revenue generating segment.


- **Growth Quality Analysis**  
Revenue YoY growth rate is used to analyze SOFi’s performance compared to past years and key drivers affecting it.


- **Efficiency Ratio**  
Expenses to Revenue ratio is accessed to understand how SOFi is expanding in terms of increased spending vs platform expansion.

- **Product Ecosystem Expansion**  
An assessment of growth in products, members, and accounts over time.

## 🧠 Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings
As of **Dec 2024**, maximum revenue is generated by Lending Segment while non-lending (Financial services and Technology platform) revenue share has significantly rose from 19.13% in 2020 to 45.49% in 2024 showing SOFi has shifted away from only a loan providing company to a more diversified revenue model in alignment to its tech-first strategy. 

- This trend signals a meaningful transition from a **loan-centric model** toward a **technology-driven, diversified platform**
